    <h1><font size="10"<h3>Lightbot Reflection</h1>
     <h1><font size="5"<h3>Lightbot is much like a computer because of the mechanics of the game. The game works with a series of inputs and outputs that do specific functions which is the same operations ran on a computer along with 
     the different combinations of loops and procedures just on a much smaller scale. The reason why lightbot is different from a computer is that it has limits, you can only move within your boundaries and there is a limit to how much
     coding you can actually do, while a computer has seemingly infinite possibility.</h1>

      <h1><font size="10"<h3>Conclusion</h1>
     <h1><font size="5"<h3>Writing code in smaller pieces allows you to revise more easily and complete the coding in chunks without having to review massive amounts of coding, it leaves less room for error.
     <br>
     <br>
     Building LEGO’s is a good example of figuring out a difficult problem when an error was made. Much like the program in coding when you build the LEGO creation you can make an error that you don’t notice 
     until you’ve completed the creation. This forces you to backtrack to discover mistakes.

     Our group thinks that the processors have multiple programs opened at once and cycles through the commands of each program in order and continues to do this at a fast pace giving the illusion that multiple 
     programs are being ran at once.</h1>

     <h1><font size="10"<h3>Blown to Bits Reflection</h1>
     <h1><font size="5"<h3>I believe that computers have revolutionized society. Technology advancements have affected many and will continue to do so, some effects are positive while others negative. Whether or not technology is good 
     for society is subjective regardless of the answer we have moved forwards with it and it is here to stay. Personally I enjoy technology but I’m still cautious of it’s negative potential.</h1>

    <h1><font size="10"<h3>1.2.3 Conclusion</h1>
     <h1><font size="5"<h3>The objects are less organized wth more optiona and have no command for when the program starts.

     There are other imputs that you need to notice such as screen rotation, direction, camera, coding is alike the computer but the mobile is more set towards tapping and in ways is limited because of this.</h1>
