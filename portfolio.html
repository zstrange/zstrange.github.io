     <h1><font size="10"<h3>Lightbot is much like a computer because of the mechanics of the game. The game works with a series of inputs and outputs that do specific functions which is the same operations ran on a computer along with 
     the different combinations of loops and procedures just on a much smaller scale. The reason why lightbot is different from a computer is that it has limits, you can only move within your boundaries and there is a limit to how much
     coding you can actually do, while a computer has seemingly infinite possibility.</h1>
